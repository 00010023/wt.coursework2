# Documentation

## The idea of that website

Actually it was suggested to create a README.md file on the root path of
project. However, I came up with an idea making that documentation as a website
either. Personally, I think, reading a whore readme file is boring & painful as
writing hello world on asm86x. Moreover, with the help of my knowledge on
Vue.js, I created yet another website for the documentation part.

## Requirements...

It was asked to provide a clear definition of project's structure and objective.
