# Client side

## Which framework does stands for my coursework?

Actually, for the client side of the application, I used a framework namely
Next.js which is way more convenient compared to another frameworks. I could do
it SSR and implement all front things inside express front end renderer but, my
creativeness wouldn't let me do this as a senior developer.

## How to run the application (a step-by-step noob included instructions)

### Windows users:

Hello Windows users! I guess 80% of my audience is reading windows based guides,
so I'll try to explain everything in a nutshell.

I assume that you have already cloned my project. If you didn't, just spawn a
terminal somewhere then execute the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/00010023/wt.coursework2.git 00010023
```

Now, if enter `dir` command, we will see that we have cloned my project into the
current directory and result should be something like that:

```
Directory of C:\Users\Genemator\bla\bla\bla

xx/xx/2021  09:00 PM    <DIR>          .
xx/xx/2021  09:00 PM    <DIR>          ..
xx/xx/2021  09:00 PM    <DIR>          00010023
xx/xx/2021  09:00 PM    <DIR>          Bla
xx/xx/2021  09:00 PM    <DIR>          Bla
               x File(s)             x bytes
               x Dir(s)              x bytes free
```

Yay, now we have the source codes stored in our PC. Now, open my project through
terminal.

```shell
cd 00010023
```

### UNIX Typo / GNU Linux users

Hola my Amigos! Dear UNIX|Linux users, my friends, I've already prepared
everything for you and made the process of launching quite easier compared to
Windows shits.
