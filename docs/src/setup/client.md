# Client side

## Which framework does stands for my coursework?

Actually, for the client side of the application, I used a framework namely
Next.js which is way more convenient compared to another frameworks. I could do
it SSR and implement all front things inside express front end renderer but, my
creativeness wouldn't let me do this as a senior developer.

## How to run the application (a step-by-step instructions)

### Windows users:

Hello Windows users! I guess 80% of my audience is reading windows based guides,
so I'll try to explain everything in a nutshell.

I assume that you have already cloned my project. If you didn't, just spawn a
terminal somewhere then execute the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/00010023/wt.coursework2.git 00010023
```

Yay, now we have the source codes stored in our PC. Now, open my project through
terminal.

```shell
cd 00010023
```

### UNIX Typo / GNU Linux users

Hola my Amigos! Dear UNIX|Linux users, my friends, I've already prepared
everything for you and made the process of launching quite easier compared to
Windows shits.
