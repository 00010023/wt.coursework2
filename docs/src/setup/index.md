# The App, the beginning

**The application itself consists of 3 parts whereas they are:**

- Front End Part [Next.js] [Press to open guide](server.md)
- Back End Part [Express.js] [Press to open guide](client.md)
- Documentation Part [Vue.js] _"Docs for this part is self included"_

**The base is not counted as one of them so:**

- The base [Prettier, GitHub CI, Tests, Lint]

### Attention!

> Before running any part of application, don't forget to install dependencies
> for each part of applications. If you're GNU LINUX/UNIX user, just use
> ./install.sh script on a root path of project folder. It will do everything
> for you 😉
