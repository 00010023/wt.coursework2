Dear staff, student or whomever you are, I know that you're bored with
scriptkiddies' coursework. Now, let me take your time more joyful and in a way
more interesting. All you have to do is just launch the documentation website
that is hosted on cloud either you can run it locally too. Also, my
documentation website has a dark mode which doesn't attract bugs & errors. By
the way, **it's highly recommended running my project on top of UNIX typo system
(e.g. any type of Linux Distributions or macOS[Darwin])**. Nevertheless, my
shell scripts that was tended to work on Linux command line interface won't work
on _cocky Windows Operating System_. Also, dear staff, please, don't take my
"Mr. Noob" too serious. By saying that I was addressing to another WIUT BIS
students.

### For cloud solutions ☁️

- Open the website [https://doc.genemator.uz](https://doc.genemator.uz)

### For local instances 💻

- Spawn a terminal session in docs directory inside root path of the project
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install` regarding your preferred package manager.
- Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` (up to your preference).
- Wait for a couple of minutes
- Open browser and enter `http://localhost:3002`
