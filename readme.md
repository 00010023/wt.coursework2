Dear staff, I know that you're shitty bored with scriptkiddies' coursework. Now,
let me take your time more joyful and in a way more interesting. All you have to
do is just launch the documentation website that is hosted on cloud either you
can run it locally too.

### For cloud solutions

Open the website [https://doc.genemator.me](https://doc.genemator.me)

### For local instances

1. Open terminal inside docs directory
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` regarding your preferred package manager.
3. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` (up to your preference).
