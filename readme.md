Dear staff, I know that you're shitty bored with scriptkiddies' coursework. Now,
let me take your time more joyful and in a way more interesting. All you have to
do is just launch the documentation website that is hosted on cloud either you
can run it locally too. Also, my documentation website has a dark mode which
doesn't attract bugs & errors. By the way, **it's highly recommended running my
project on top of UNIX typo system (e.g. any type of Linux Distributions or
macOS[Darwin])**. Nevertheless, my shell scripts that was tended to work on
Linux command line interface won't work on _cocky Windows Operating System_.

### For cloud solutions

Open the website [https://doc.genemator.me](https://doc.genemator.me)

### For local instances

1. Open terminal inside docs directory
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` regarding your preferred package manager.
3. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` (up to your preference).
4. Wait for a couple of minutes
5. Open browser and enter `http://localhost:3002`
